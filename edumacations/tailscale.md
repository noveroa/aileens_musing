What is Tailscale?

Tailscale is a mesh VPN built on top of WireGuard. It lets you create a private, secure network between your devices (laptops, servers, phones, containers, etc.) without needing complex VPN configurations. Once devices are authenticated with your Tailscale account, they can directly connect to each other over encrypted tunnels — even across NATs and firewalls.

Key points:
	•	Zero-config networking: Devices just join the same tailnet (your private network).
	•	End-to-end encryption: Traffic is secured with WireGuard.
	•	Access control: You can define who can access what through ACLs.
	•	Works anywhere: Devices get a stable Tailscale IP, accessible regardless of location.

Public Expose Feature

Normally, Tailscale only allows connections inside your tailnet (private network).
The “Public Sharing / Expose” feature lets you make a service running on your machine (e.g., a web server on localhost:8080) publicly accessible via a Tailscale-managed URL like:

`https://<random-subdomain>.ts.net`

	•	Tailscale acts as a reverse proxy.
	•	TLS certificates are automatically handled.
	•	No need to open firewall ports or manage DNS.
	•	Anyone with the link can access the service, even if they’re not in your tailnet.

This is great for demos, testing, or sharing tools temporarily.

Using Tailscale Expose with Nginx

If you’re running Nginx as a web server or reverse proxy:
	1.	Local service setup: Nginx listens on a local port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080 or 443).
	2.	Expose via Tailscale: Run
`tailscale serve https / nginx`
`tailscale funnel 443`

depending on whether you want internal-only (serve) or public (funnel) exposure.

	3.	Integration: Tailscale terminates TLS and forwards traffic to Nginx. You don’t need to manage SSL certs in Nginx for the public URL — Tailscale handles that.
	4.	Use case:
	•	Run Nginx as a reverse proxy for your app.
	•	Expose it through Tailscale’s public URL.
	•	Your app is instantly reachable over HTTPS with no DNS setup.

⸻

✅ In short: Tailscale sets up secure networking between devices. The public expose feature lets you safely share services outside your private network via a Tailscale-provided HTTPS endpoint. With Nginx, you just configure your local site normally and let Tailscale handle secure, public access.

	•	Tailscale = secure mesh VPN (WireGuard-based) for private networking across devices.
	•	Public expose = lets you share a local service via a Tailscale-provided HTTPS URL (no DNS/firewall setup needed).
	•	With Nginx = you run Nginx normally on localhost, then Tailscale forwards traffic from the public URL to Nginx, handling TLS and access.

# Tailscale and Kubernetes
(kubernetes operator)[https://tailscale.com/kb/1236/kubernetes-operator]
(TailScale Operator)[https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/cmd/k8s-operator/deploy/manifests/operator.yaml]

* The Tailscale Kubernetes Operator lets you:
    * Access the Kubernetes control plane using an API server proxy
    * Expose a tailnet service to your Kubernetes cluster (cluster egress)
    * Expose a cluster workload to your tailnet (cluster ingress)
    * Expose a cluster workload to another cluster (cross-cluster connectivity)
    * Expose a cloud service to your tailnet
    * Deploy exit nodes and subnet routers
    * Deploy app connector
    * Deploy tsrecorder
    * Expose multi-cluster applications to internal users
    * Manage multi-cluster deployments with ArgoCD


    1.	Tailscale-managed Ingresses/Services stop working
	•	Any Ingress or Service annotated for Tailscale (like tailscale.com/funnel: "true") will no longer be exposed.
	•	The operator normally creates/maintains the Tailscale proxy pods. Without it, those pods won’t run.
	2.	No new Tailscale exposure
	•	You won’t be able to publish new services to your tailnet or to the public internet via Tailscale.
	3.	Existing proxies break
	•	If the operator was managing existing proxy pods, they’ll eventually stop working (immediately if deleted, or later if they crash/are rescheduled).
	•	Tailscale won’t refresh credentials, Funnel certificates, or tunnels.
	4.	Cluster networking falls back to normal
	•	Your services remain reachable inside the cluster and via any standard ingress/load balancer you had.
	•	But they won’t be reachable via Tailscale’s .ts.net URLs or your private tailnet IPs.



* Tailscale Overview
>Tailscale is a mesh VPN service built on WireGuard that creates secure, encrypted connections between devices across networks. It simplifies networking by automatically establishing peer-to-peer connections.

* Tailscale Operator Concept
> The Tailscale Operator is a Kubernetes controller that manages Tailscale resources within your cluster

* Tailscale Proxy Concepts
	* Subnet Router (Proxy)
		* Acts as a gateway for non-Tailscale devices
		* Allows access to entire subnets through a single Tailscale node
	    * Common in Kubernetes for exposing services
	* Exit Node
		* Routes all internet traffic through a designated node
		* Useful for consistent outbound IP addresses
		* Security and compliance benefits
	* Service Mesh Integration
		* Secure pod-to-pod communication
		* Cross-cluster networking
		* Zero-trust network access
	* Common Use Cases in Kubernetes
		* Secure Service Access
			* Expose internal services without public load balancers
			* Direct access to databases, APIs, monitoring tools
		* Multi-Cluster Connectivity
			* Connect services across different clusters
			* Hybrid cloud networking
		* Developer Access
			* Secure access to development/staging environments
			* No need for complex VPN setups
