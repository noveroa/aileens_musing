# Six principles of Sustainable Software Engineering
> shared understanding of what it means to be a Sustainable Software Engineer

* Carbon Efficiency
    * Build applications that are carbon efficient.
    * code efficiency (minimize computation resources), opting for efficient languges (C/C++), Avoid redundancy, optiize data strucutres, lazy loading
    * architecture - right sizes resourecs, dynamic allocation (autoscaling), caching. reduce network traffic, serverless, IAC
    * data management - efficient storage/access, lifecycles, 
* Electricity Efficiency
    * Build applications that are energy efficient.
    * Code and computational efficiency - use less power! burn less fossil fuels!
* Carbon Awareness
    * Consume electricity with the lowest carbon intensity.
    * renewable energy options
    * demand shaping - move usage to regions when demans change
* Hardware Efficiency
    * Build applications that are hardware efficient.
    * don't waste hardware, extend lifetimes
* Measurement
    * Improve sustainability through measurement.
* Climate Commitments
    * Defining the exact mechanism of carbon reduction.

* Two Philosophies 
    * Everyone has a part to play in the climate solution.
        * you're part of a massive global movement of people who care and are taking action. 
        * Sustainable Software Engineers work in every discipline across engineering, from designing silicon to designing user experiences.
        * Nothing happens in isolation, everything is connected, and small changes lead to significant changes. 
        * Normalizing sustainability discussions in technical meetings empowers others to raise their voices. That's how you create change in any organization.
    * Sustainability is enough, all by itself, to justify our work
        * recognize many advantages to building sustainable applications. They're almost always cheaper, they're often more performant, and they're often more resilient. B
       * But primarily practicing Sustainable Software Engineering for sustainability; 
        * **everything else is an added advantage.**
