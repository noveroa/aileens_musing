## Imperitive Vs Declarative Approach

* Imperitive
    * How it is done
    * Describes how a program should achieve a desired state by providing **explicit, step-by-step instructions.**
    * Emphasizes control flow and state changes.
    * Involves detailed instructions on manipulating variables and data structures.
        *  Examples: C, C++, Java, Python (often used imperatively).
    * Analogy: Providing a recipe with precise steps for baking a cake.

* Declarative 
    * The end result
    * Describes the desired outcome or state should be, without specifying the exact steps 
    *  Emphasizes expressions and transformations.
    * Relies on the system or language to determine the execution details.
        * Examples: SQL, HTML, CSS, functional programming languages (like Haskell, or using functional constructs in Python/JavaScript).
    * Analogy: Ordering a cake from a bakery, simply stating the type of cake you want.
