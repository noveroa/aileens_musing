A pipeline, in general, is a set of automated tasks/processes defined and followed by the software engineering team. 
DevOps pipeline is a pipeline which allows the DevOps engineers and the software developers to efficiently and reliably compile, build and deploy the software code to the production environments in a hassle free manner.

ie. Jenkins pipeline:

1. Source Code Management: 
    * Checkout: The pipeline starts by retrieving the source code from a version control system (like Git) using the checkout stage.
2. Build and Test: 
    * Build:
        * The application is built using the appropriate tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm) within a defined build environment (possibly a Docker container).
    * Test:
        * Unit tests, integration tests, and other relevant tests are executed to ensure code quality.
3. Containerization: 
    * Dockerfile:
        * A Dockerfile is used to define how the application and its dependencies are packaged into a Docker image.
    * Docker Build:
        * The docker build command is used to create the Docker image based on the Dockerfile.
4. Artifactory Integration: 
    * Configure Artifactory:
        * The Jenkins Artifactory plugin is configured to interact with the Artifactory instance, including setting up credentials and specifying the Docker registry URL.
    * Docker Registry:
        * Artifactory is set up as a Docker registry, and the Jenkins Artifactory plugin is configured to interact with it.
    *  Publish Docker Images:
        * The Docker images are pushed to the Artifactory Docker registry using the docker push command.
    * Build Info:
        * The pipeline can be configured to publish build information to Artifactory, including metadata about the build and the Docker image.
5. Deployment (Optional): 
    * Deploy: Once the Docker image is successfully published, it can be deployed to various environments (e.g., staging, production) using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

> Example Jenkinsfile Snippet:
```sh
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'your_repo_url'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install' // Or your build command
            }
        }
        stage('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    dockerImage = docker.build("your-image-name:${env.BUILD_ID}", '.') // Build the Docker image
                    dockerImage.push("${env.BUILD_ID}") // Push to the registry
                    // Optionally, publish build info
                    rtDocker.publishBuildInfo(dockerImage)
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                   // Run tests (e.g., using JUnit)
                   junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        // Add a deploy stage if needed
        stage('Deploy') {
           steps {
               //Deploy your application to the target environment
           }
        }
    }
}
```
