The main difference between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery are given below:

| Continuous Deployment | 	Continuous Delivery|
| --- | ---|
|
The deployment to the production environment is fully automated and does not require manual/ human intervention.	| In this process, some amount of manual intervention with the managerâ€™s approval is needed for deployment to a production environment.|
Here, the application is run by following the automated set of instructions, and no approvals are needed.|	Here, the working of the application depends on the decision of the team.|
