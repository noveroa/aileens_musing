###### 
DevOps mainly has 6 phases and they are:

* Planning:
>This is the first phase of a DevOps lifecycle that involves a thorough understanding of the project to ultimately develop the best product. When done properly, this phase gives various inputs required for the development and operations phases. This phase also helps the organization to gain clarity regarding the project development and management process.

Tools: Google Apps, Asana, Microsoft teams, etc are used for this purpose.

* Development:
>The planning phase is followed by the Development phase where the project is built by developing system infrastructure, developing features by writing codes, and then defining test cases and the automation process. Developers store their codes in a code manager called remote repository which aids in team collaboration by allowing view, modification, and versioning of the code.

Tools: git, IDEs like the eclipse, IntelliJ, and technological stacks like Node, Java, etc are used.

* Continuous Integration (CI):
>This phase allows for automation of code validation, build, and testing. This ensures that the changes are made properly without development environment errors and also allows the identification of errors at an initial stage.

Tools: Jenkins, circleCI, etc are used here.

* Deployment:
> DevOps aids in the deployment automation process by making use of tools and scripts which has the final goal of automating the process by means of feature activation. Here, cloud services can be used as a force that assists in upgrade from finite infrastructure management to cost-optimized management with the potential to infinite resources.

Tools: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Heroku, etc are used.

* Operations:
> This phase usually occurs throughout the lifecycle of the product/software due to the dynamic infrastructural changes. This provides the team with opportunities for increasing the availability, scalability, and effective transformation of the product.

Tools: Loggly, BlueJeans, Appdynamics, etc are used commonly in this phase.

* Monitoring:
> Monitoring is a permanent phase of DevOps methodology. This phase is used for monitoring and analyzing information to know the status of software applications.

Tools: Nagios, Splunk, etc are commonly used.
