re: Helm and Kubernetes, 

HULL (Helm Uniform Layer Library) is a Helm library chart designed to simplify the creation, maintenance, and configuration of Kubernetes objects within Helm charts. 
It acts as an extension or plugin to Helm, providing helper functions and a standardized interface for managing Kubernetes resources. 

## Resources 
* [Medium Tutotial - HULL](https://dev.to/gre9ory/hull-tutorial-01-introducing-hull-the-helm-universal-layer-library-4njb)
* [Hull Git](github.com/vidispine/hull)

## Key Ideas
*  Helm
    * package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment, management, and upgrades of applications. 
* Helm Charts
    * Helm packages applications in the form of charts, which are essentially collections of files that describe Kubernetes resources. 
* HULL as a Library Chart:
    * HULL is a **special** type of Helm chart, specifically a "library chart," which doesn't deploy anything on its own but provides reusable components and functionalities for other charts. 


## Benefits of HULL:
> HULL aims to reduce boilerplate code, standardize configuration, validate Kubernetes objects, and automatically add metadata, making Helm chart creation more efficient and less error-prone. 
How HULL Works:
* Integration
    * HULL is added as a dependency to your existing Helm chart. 
* Centralized Configuration
    * HULL provides a single, well-documented configuration interface for all Kubernetes objects. 
* YAML Rendering
    * HULL leverages Helm's Go templating capabilities to dynamically render Kubernetes YAML, reducing the need for custom templates. 
* Validation and Metadata
    * HULL automatically validates Kubernetes objects against the API and adds standard metadata. 
* ConfigMaps and Secrets
    * HULL simplifies the integration of ConfigMaps and Secrets into your Helm charts. 

_In essence, HULL provides a layer of abstraction and standardization on top of the regular Helm workflow, allowing developers to focus on the specific configurations of their applications rather than the boilerplate code associated with Kubernetes manifests_
